        <p style="text-align:center">One best way to make sure you cover self-care in your routines is to add skincare to it. This is because skincare is self-care and it can be significantly rewarding. Not only is it soothing and calming, but It also has been proven to be beneficial in a number of ways.</p>
        <p style="text-align:center">Self-care can mean different things to each individual, but the overarching goal is to feel good, happy, and calm. For many, engaging in a skin care routine—regardless of whether it involves 10 steps or 3 steps—can help reduce daily stress, as it’s a chance to take a break. You don’t even have to be a skin care buff to embrace self-care through your daily routine, so long as you are taking time for yourself to disconnect from stressors and focus on yourself. Keep in mind that embracing self-care doesn’t have to mean splurging on expensive skin care products or devices. More so than the product(s) you use, the real benefit you can experience is from taking that “me” time. Still, there are certain skin care products that can help you achieve a truly relaxing, spa-worthy experience from head-to-toe. Here, we share some of our favorite products—from the LOréal portfolio of brands— that can help you look and feel good. </p>
